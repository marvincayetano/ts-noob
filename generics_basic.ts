// While using any is certainly generic in that it will cause the function to accept any and all types for the type of arg, we actually are losing the information about what that type was when the function returns. If we passed in a number, the only information we have is that any type could be returned.

// Instead, we need a way of capturing the type of the argument in such a way that we can also use it to denote what is being returned. Here, we will use a type variable, a special kind of variable that works on types rather than values.

function identity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}

// You can read the type of loggingIdentity as “the generic function loggingIdentity takes a type parameter Type, and an argument arg which is an array of Types, and returns an array of Types.” If we passed in an array of numbers, we’d get an array of numbers back out, as Type would bind to number. This allows us to use our generic type variable Type as part of the types we’re working with, rather than the whole type, giving us greater flexibility.

function loggingIdentity<Type>(arg: Array<Type>): Array<Type> {
  console.log(arg.length); // Array has a .length, so no more error
  return arg;
}
